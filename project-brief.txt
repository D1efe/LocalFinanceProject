Create a localised finance checking webapp
makes use of AngularJS and Java with maven

notes:
Create an application that tracks incoming and outgoing transactions
transactions are set manually by the user
transactions can be dated
transaction will be a class containing: description, date and amount
Learn and make use of docker

Not sure how to implement initial starting value (possibly as part of a user)
or as a stand-a-lone attribute?

possible functionality:
Add user accounts
set-up a local database to store user information
Allow for multiple entries to track transactions for different accounts.
